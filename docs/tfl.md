# TfL 

To get tube data, you'll need connect to TfL who operate a subscription key authentication model. It's free,  but  you'll need to first register yourself and your app at [https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/).

Once done, you apply the app key to the bot's configuration or startup: [see bot_config.md](./bot_config.md).
