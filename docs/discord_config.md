# Discord Integration

You'll need to set up a Discord bot account. You can register your own [Discord bots here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/), and [Discord.Net gives a good introduction guide](https://discordnet.dev/guides/getting_started/first-bot.html).

The bot will scan discord users' messages and react to them accordingly. 

You'll need the bot's client ID, secret and token in the configuration, and give the bot the following permissions:

* ``send messages``
* ``create public threads``
* ``create private threads``
* ``send messages in threads``
* ``embed links``
* ``attach files``
* ``read message history``
